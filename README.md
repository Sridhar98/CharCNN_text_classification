## Abstract
This repository contains aPyTorch implementation 
and extension of [Character-level Convolutional 
Networks for Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626)
Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao and Yann LeCun (2015). 
Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of treating
text at the character level and applying convolutional networks
(ConvNets) for text classification on various datasets. An ablation
study and test on a sarcasm detection dataset provide further 
insights into the architecture.
